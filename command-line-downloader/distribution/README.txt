For support/issues, please contact us at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/support

There are two ways to run the tool :

1. Interactive : Use this the first time you run the tool, to navigate through the available options and create a simple
script that can be invoked directly later
java -jar ena-file-downloader.jar

OR call one of the convenience scripts provided.

Linux/Unix:
./run.sh
You may need to give the script permissions to be runnable as follows:
chmod + run.sh

On Windows:
run.bat

The user will be prompted to select options  (`eg : accessions, format, location, protocol, aspera connect location,email`) and in the end will be
prompted with the below options :

* `To start downloading right now, and also create a script that can be invoked directly, please enter 1`

*  `To create a script that can be invoked directly (e.g. by a pipeline or a script), enter 2`

If the user selects 1, then download will start right away in the current console, but also create a script.
If the user selects 2, then a script file will be created inside the current folder with the inputs received that can be invoked directly.

2. Non-interactive: Provide parameters to the tool directly. It is recommended you use Interactive mode to create a
script and modify it if required.
